# badminton-check-in
Badminton Check In, that takes in a sign in csv (in this case a sample csv) and displays it on a static html page. 
This program is to be used by the Badminton Club at Carleton for easier check ins. 

## Getting Started 

Please download the sample .csv file that is the standard I would be expecting during a regular check in at my club.
